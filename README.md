## Supplementary Material / Folder Structure

- [This repository](./) contains all the primary scripts including some assets for replicating the methodology and its experiments for Traffic Editor.
- [This folder](./Unity3DProject/) contains the Unity 3D project which I implemented via Unity 3D version `Unity3D 2018.4.16f1`. Note that "EasyMovieTexture" plugin is not uploaded because it's copyright, but you can download it elsewhere or directly use other related plugins to replace it.
- [This folder](./Submission) serves as source templates I used for crafting and submitting the paper.
- [This site](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish) contains the software I utilized for collecting and searching the desired papers.
- [This](LLM-Enhanced_Traffic_Editor_for_Accelerated_Testing_of_Autonomous_Vehicles_under_Various_Pedestrian_Behaviors-arxiv.pdf) is the duplicate of the paper downloaded from [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/NOT_YET_UPLOADED), which is the **full version** that I recommend.
- [This](LLM-Enhanced_Traffic_Editor_for_Accelerated_Testing_of_Autonomous_Vehicles_under_Various_Pedestrian_Behaviors.pdf) is the duplicate of the manuscript I submitted to the conference. **Due to page limitation, some content has been omitted**.
